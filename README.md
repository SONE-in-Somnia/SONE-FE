# 🎉 Fuku - No-Loss Savings & Rewards System on Monad

Fuku is a decentralized savings and rewards platform that allows users to deposit funds, earn yield, and have a chance to win rewards—all while ensuring their principal remains safe. Built on **Monad**, Fuku leverages fast, scalable, and efficient blockchain technology to provide a seamless DeFi experience.

## 🌸 What Does "Fuku" Mean?

The name **Fuku (福)** comes from Japanese, meaning **"good fortune" or "blessing."**  
Fuku embodies the concept of **safe saving with a chance to receive lucky rewards**, aligning with the philosophy of bringing prosperity to users while ensuring financial security.  

Just like traditional Japanese "Fukubukuro" (福袋, "lucky bags"), where people receive surprise rewards, Fuku brings **excitement to saving**—every deposit has the potential for extra rewards!

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Deposit Funds**: Users deposit supported tokens into the Fuku smart contract on Monad.
2. **Yield Generation**: Deposits are allocated to DeFi yield strategies to generate interest.
3. **Reward Distribution**: The earned yield is distributed periodically to randomly selected participants.
4. **No Loss Mechanism**: Users can withdraw their deposits anytime without losing their principal.
